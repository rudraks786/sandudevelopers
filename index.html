Sandu as a brand has always delivered-best in class quality, sophistication and stylish constructions. Though a Chemburkar, his work has not been confined to Chembur and has spread beyond. So, for me trust, quality & style spells out <strong>SANDU DEVELOPERS</strong>.

                      Kudos to Dhananjay and Yashodhan and entire <strong>SANDU DEVELOPERS</strong> group for carrying out a splendid job in developing our home. Right from the first step we were well updated on the process and all our queries were promptly resolved. We were provided with great quality material and work, making the house as well as the building standout as an increasingly desirable and lavish place to reside. Being a part of the family gives me immense pleasure to see my brothers achieve remarkable goals and change the look of our area. Keep up the great work.

                      I had approached <strong>SANDU DEVELOPERS</strong> in the year 2013 for redevelopment of our building. We saw their completed redevelopment projects and liked the quality so finally decided to proceed with overall consent. We have now completed 3 years in our new building and the quality is impeccable. We continue to have a very cordial relationship with them. We hope they get more projects in Mulund
and they grow in terms of business and prosperity.

                      In 2008 when our society Ganga Vihar decided to go for redevelopment, we had our first interaction with <strong>SANDU DEVELOPERS</strong>. Their untiring commitment to give the best to their customers/clients stood out. In spite of suffering all the hurdles, they never delayed or skipped a single payment of the rent they had promised to pay to the members unlike most in the market. Besides this, they never deviated from their commitment of giving the best quality product.
